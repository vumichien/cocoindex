# Data Types in CocoIndex

In CocoIndex, all data processed by the flow have a type determined when the flow is defined, before any actual data is processed at runtime.

This makes schema of data processed by CocoIndex clear, and easily determine the schema of your index.

## Data Types

As an engine written in Rust, designed to be used in different languages and data are always serializable, CocoIndex defines a type system independent of any specific programming language.

CocoIndex automatically infers data types of the output created by CocoIndex sources and functions.
You don't need to spell out any data type explicitly when you define the flow.
All you need to do is to make sure the data passed to functions and targets are compatible with them.

Each type in CocoIndex type system is mapped to one or multiple types in Python.
When you define a [custom function](/docs/core/custom_function), you need to annotate the data types of arguments and return values.

*   When you pass a Python value to the engine (e.g. return values of a custom function), type annotation is required,
    as it provides the ground truth of the data type in the flow.

*   When you use a Python variable to bind to an engine value (e.g. arguments of a custom function),
    we use the type annotation as a guidance to construct the Python value.
    Type annotation is optional for basic types and struct types, and required for table types.

*   When you define a [custom function](/docs/core/custom_function), type annotation is required for arguments and return values.

### Basic Types

#### Primitive Types

Primitive types are basic types that are not composed of other types.
This is the list of all primitive types supported by CocoIndex:

| CocoIndex Type | Python Types | Convertible to | Explanation |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| *Bytes* | `bytes` | | |
| *Str* | `str` | | |
| *Bool* | `bool` | | |
| *Int64* | `cocoindex.Int64`, `int`, `numpy.int64` | | |
| *Float32* | `cocoindex.Float32`, `numpy.float32` | *Float64* | |
| *Float64* |  `cocoindex.Float64`, `float`, `numpy.float64` | | |
| *Range* | `cocoindex.Range` | | |
| *Uuid* | `uuid.UUId` | | |
| *Date* | `datetime.date` | | |
| *Time* | `datetime.time` | | |
| *LocalDatetime* | `cocoindex.LocalDateTime` | *OffsetDatetime* | without timezone |
| *OffsetDatetime* | `cocoindex.OffsetDateTime`, `datetime.datetime` | | with timezone |
| *TimeDelta* | `datetime.timedelta` | | |

Notes:

*   For some CocoIndex types, we support multiple Python types. You can annotate with any of these Python types.
    The first one is the default type, i.e. CocoIndex will create a value with this type when the type annotation is not provided (e.g. for arguments of a custom function).

*   All Python types starting with `cocoindex.` are type aliases exported by CocoIndex. They're annotated types based on certain Python types:

    *   `cocoindex.Int64`: `int`
    *   `cocoindex.Float64`: `float`
    *   `cocoindex.Float32`: `float`
    *   `cocoindex.Range`: `tuple[int, int]`, i.e. a start offset (inclusive) and an end offset (exclusive)
    *   `cocoindex.OffsetDateTime`: `datetime.datetime`
    *   `cocoindex.LocalDateTime`: `datetime.datetime`

    These aliases provide a non-ambiguous way to represent a specific type in CocoIndex, given their base Python types can represent a superset of possible values.

*   When we say a CocoIndex type is *convertible to* another type, it means Python types for the second type can be also used to bind to a value of the first type.
    *   For example, *Float32* is convertible to *Float64*, so you can bind a value of *Float32* to a Python value of `float` or `np.float64` types.
    *   For *LocalDatetime*, when you use `cocoindex.OffsetDateTime` or `datetime.datetime` as the annotation to bind its value, the timezone will be set to UTC.


#### Json Type

*Json* type can hold any data convertible to JSON by `json` package.
In Python, it's represented by `cocoindex.Json`.
It's useful to hold data without fixed schema known at flow definition time.


#### Vector Types

A vector type is a collection of elements of the same basic type.
Optionally, it can have a fixed dimension. Noted as *Vector[Type]* or *Vector[Type, Dim]*, e.g. *Vector[Float32]* or *Vector[Float32, 384]*.

It supports the following Python types:

*   `cocoindex.Vector[T]` or `cocoindex.Vector[T, typing.Literal[Dim]]`, e.g. `cocoindex.Vector[cocoindex.Float32]` or `cocoindex.Vector[cocoindex.Float32, 384]`
    *   The underlying Python type is `numpy.typing.NDArray[T]` where `T` is a numpy numeric type (`numpy.int64`, `numpy.float32` or `numpy.float64`), or `list[T]` otherwise
*   `numpy.typing.NDArray[T]` where `T` is a numpy numeric type
*   `list[T]`


#### Union Types

A union type is a type that can represent values in one of multiple basic types.
Noted as *Type1* | *Type2* | ..., e.g. *Int64* | *Float32* | *Float64*.

The Python type is `T1 | T2 | ...`, e.g. `cocoindex.Int64 | cocoindex.Float32 | cocoindex.Float64`, `int | float` (equivalent to `cocoindex.Int64 | cocoindex.Float64`)


### Struct Types

A *Struct* has a bunch of fields, each with a name and a type.

In Python, a *Struct* type is represented by either a [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
or a [NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple), with all fields annotated with a specific type.
Both options define a structured type with named fields, but they differ slightly:

- **Dataclass**: A flexible class-based structure, mutable by default, defined using the `@dataclass` decorator.
- **NamedTuple**: An immutable tuple-based structure, defined using `typing.NamedTuple`.

For example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NamedTuple
import datetime

# Using dataclass
@dataclass
class Person:
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    dob: datetime.date

# Using NamedTuple
class PersonTuple(NamedTuple):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    dob: datetime.date
```

Both `Person` and `PersonTuple` are valid Struct types in CocoIndex, with identical schemas (three fields: `first_name` (Str), `last_name` (Str), `dob` (Date)).
Choose `dataclass` for mutable objects or when you need additional methods, and `NamedTuple` for immutable, lightweight structures.

Besides, for arguments of custom functions, CocoIndex also supports using dictionaries (`dict[str, Any]`) to represent a *Struct* type.
It's the default Python type if you don't annotate the function argument.

### Table Types

A *Table* type models a collection of rows, each with multiple columns.
Each column of a table has a specific type.

We have two specific types of *Table* types: *KTable* and *LTable*.

#### KTable

*KTable* is a *Table* type whose first column serves as the key.
The row order of a *KTable* is not preserved.
Type of the first column (key column) must be a [key type](#key-types).

In Python, a *KTable* type is represented by `dict[K, V]`. 
The `V` should be a *Struct* type, either a `dataclass` or `NamedTuple`, representing the value fields of each row.
For example, you can use `dict[str, Person]` or `dict[str, PersonTuple]` to represent a *KTable*, with 4 columns: key (*Str*), `first_name` (*Str*), `last_name` (*Str*), `dob` (*Date*).

Note that if you want to use a *Struct* as the key, you need to ensure its value in Python is immutable. For `dataclass`, annotate it with `@dataclass(frozen=True)`. For `NamedTuple`, immutability is built-in. For example:
For example:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PersonKey:
    id_kind: str
    id: str

class PersonKeyTuple(NamedTuple):
    id_kind: str
    id: str
```

Then you can use `dict[PersonKey, Person]` or `dict[PersonKeyTuple, PersonTuple]` to represent a KTable keyed by `PersonKey` or `PersonKeyTuple`.


#### LTable

*LTable* is a *Table* type whose row order is preserved. *LTable* has no key column.

In Python, a *LTable* type is represented by `list[R]`, where `R` is a dataclass representing a row.
For example, you can use `list[Person]` to represent a *LTable* with 3 columns: `first_name` (*Str*), `last_name` (*Str*), `dob` (*Date*).

## Key Types

Currently, the following types are key types

- *Bytes*
- *Str*
- *Bool*
- *Int64*
- *Range*
- *Uuid*
- *Date*
- *Struct* with all fields being key types (using `@dataclass(frozen=True)` or `NamedTuple`)
