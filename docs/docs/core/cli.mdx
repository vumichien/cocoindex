# CocoIndex CLI

CocoIndex CLI embeds CLI functionality in your program.
It provides a bunch of commands for easily managing and inspecting your flows and indexes.

## Enable CocoIndex CLI

### Use Packaged Main

The easiest way is to use a packaged main function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python title="main.py"
import cocoindex

@cocoindex.main_fn()
def main():
  ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this, when the program is executed with `cocoindex` as its first argument, CocoIndex CLI will take over the control. For example:

```sh
$ python main.py cocoindex ls       # Run "ls" subcommand: list all flows
```

You may also provide a `cocoindex_cmd` argument to the `main_fn` decorator to change the command from `cocoindex` to something else.

### Explicitly CLI Invoke

An alterntive way is to use `cocoindex.cli.cli` (with type [`click.Group`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#click.Group)).
For example, you may invoke the CLI explicitly with additional arguments:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
cocoindex.cli.cli.main(args)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Subcommands

The following subcommands are available:

| Subcommand | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `ls` | List all flows. |
| `server` | Start a HTTP server providing REST APIs. It will allow tools like CocoInsight to access the server. |
| `setup` | Check and apply setup changes for flows, including the internal and target storage (to export). |
| `show` | Show the spec for a specific flow. |
| `update` | Update the index defined by the flow. |

Use `--help` to see the full list of subcommands, and `subcommand --help` to see the usage of a specific one.

```sh
python main.py cocoindex --help       # Show all subcommands
python main.py cocoindex show --help  # Show usage of "show" subcommand
```
