# CocoIndex Setting

Certain settings need to be provided for CocoIndex to work, e.g. database connections, app namespace, etc.

## Launch CocoIndex

You have two ways to launch CocoIndex:

*   Use [Cocoindex CLI](cli). It's handy for most routine indexing building and management tasks.
    It will load settings from environment variables, either already set in your environment, or specified in `.env` file.
    See [CLI](cli#environment-variables) for more details.

*   Call CocoIndex functionality from your own Python application or library.
    It's needed when you want to leverage CocoIndex support for query, or have your custom logic to trigger indexing, etc.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

    You need to explicitly call `cocoindex.init()` before doing anything with CocoIndex, and settings will be loaded during the call.

    *   If it's called without any argument, it will load settings from environment variables.
        Only existing environment variables already set in your environment will be used.
        If you want to load environment variables from a specific `.env` file, consider call `load_dotenv()` provided by the [`python-dotenv`](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) package.

        ```py
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import cocoindex

        load_dotenv()
        cocoindex.init()
        ```

    *   It takes an optional `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass object as argument, so you can also construct settings explicitly and pass to it:

        ```py
        import cocoindex

        cocoindex.init(
            cocoindex.Settings(
                database=cocoindex.DatabaseConnectionSpec(
                    url="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"
                )
            )
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

## List of Settings

`cocoindex.Settings` is a dataclass that contains the following fields:

*   `app_namespace` (type: `str`, required): The namespace of the application.
*   `database` (type: `DatabaseConnectionSpec`, required): The connection to the Postgres database.

### App Namespace

The `app_namespace` field helps organize flows across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production), team members, etc. When set, it prefixes flow names with the namespace.

For example, if the namespace is `Staging`, for a flow with name specified as `Flow1` in code, the full name of the flow will be `Staging.Flow1`.
You can also get the current app namespace by calling `cocoindex.get_app_namespace()` (see [Getting App Namespace](flow_def#getting-app-namespace) for more details).

If not set, all flows are in a default unnamed namespace.

*Environment variable*: `COCOINDEX_APP_NAMESPACE`

### DatabaseConnectionSpec

`DatabaseConnectionSpec` configures the connection to a database. Only Postgres is supported for now. It has the following fields:

*   `url` (type: `str`, required): The URL of the Postgres database to use as the internal storage, e.g. `postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.url`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL`

*   `user` (type: `str`, optional): The username for the Postgres database. If not provided, username will come from `url`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.user`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_USER`

*   `password` (type: `str`, optional): The password for the Postgres database. If not provided, password will come from `url`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.password`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_PASSWORD`

:::tip

Please be careful that all values in `url` needs to be url-encoded if they contain special characters.
For this reason, prefer to use the separated `user` and `password` fields for username and password.

:::info

If you use the Postgres database hosted by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), please click **Connect** on your project dashboard and find the following URL:

*    If you're on a IPv6 network, use the URL under **Direct connection**. You can visit [IPv6 test](https://test-ipv6.com/) to see if you have IPv6 Internet connection.
*    Otherwise, use the URL under **Session pooler**.
