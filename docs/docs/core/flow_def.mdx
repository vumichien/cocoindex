# CocoIndex Flow Definition

In CocoIndex, to define an indexing flow, you provide a function to construct the flow, by adding operations and connecting them with fields.

## Entry Point

A CocoIndex flow is defined by a function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

The easiest way is to use the `@cocoindex.flow_def` decorator:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
```

This `@cocoindex.flow_def` decorator declares this function as a CocoIndex flow definition.

It takes two arguments:

*   `flow_builder`: a `FlowBuilder` object to help build the flow.
*   `data_scope`: a `DataScope` object, representing the top-level data scope. Any data created by the flow should be added to it.

Alternatively, for more flexibility (e.g. you want to do this conditionally or generate dynamic name), you can explicitly call the `cocoindex.add_flow_def()` method:

```python
def demo_flow_def(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...

# Add the flow definition to the flow registry.
demo_flow = cocoindex.flow.add_flow_def("DemoFlow", demo_flow_def)
```

In both cases, `demo_flow` will be an object with `cocoindex.Flow` class type.
See [Flow Methods](/docs/core/flow_methods) for more details on it.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Flow Builder

The `FlowBuilder` object is the starting point to construct a flow.

### Import From Source

`FlowBuilder` provides a `from_source()` method to import data from external sources.
A *source spec* needs to be provided for any import operation, to describe the source and parameters related to the source.
Import must happen at the top level, and the field created by import must be in the top-level struct.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.from_source(DemoSourceSpec(...))
  ......
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

`from_source()` returns a `DataSlice`. Once external data sources are imported, you can further transform them using methods exposed by these data objects, as discussed in the following sections.

We'll describe different data objects in next few sections.
Note that the actual value of data is not available at the time when we define the flow: it's only available at runtime.
In a flow definition, you can use a data representation as input for operations, but not access the actual value.

## Data Scope

A **data scope** represents data for a certain unit, e.g. the top level scope (involving all data for a flow), for a document, or for a chunk.
A data scope has a bunch of fields and collectors, and users can add new fields and collectors to it.

### Get or Add a Field

Get or add a field of a data scope (which is a data slice). Note that you cannot override an existing field.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

Getting and setting a field of a data scope is done by the `[]` operator with a field name:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):

  # Add "documents" to the top-level data scope.
  data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.from_source(DemoSourceSpec(...))

  # Each row of "documents" is a child scope.
  with data_scope["documents"].row() as document:

    # Get "content" from the document scope, transform, and add "summary" to scope.
    document["summary"] = field1_row["content"].transform(DemoFunctionSpec(...))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add a Collector

See [Data Collector](#data-collector) below for more details.

## Data Slice

A **data slice** references a subset of data belonging to a data scope, e.g. a specific field from a data scope.
A data slice has a certain data type, and it's the input for most operations.

### Transform

`transform()` method transforms the data slice by a function, which creates another data slice.
A *function spec* needs to be provided for any transform operation, to describe the function and parameters related to the function.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
  data_scope["field1"] = data_scope["documents"].transform(DemoFunctionSpec(...))
  ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### For Each Row

If the data slice has `Table` type, you can call `row()` method to obtain a child scope representing each row, to apply operations on each row.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
  with data_scope["table1"].row() as table1_row:
    # Children operations
    table1_row["field2"] = table1_row["field1"].transform(DemoFunctionSpec(...))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Get a Sub Field

If the data slice has `Struct` type, you can obtain a data slice on a specific sub field of it, similar to getting a field of a data scope.

## Data Collector

A **data collector** can be added from a specific data scope, and it collects multiple entries of data, represented by data slices in the same or children scope.
Call its `collect()` method to collect a specific entry, which can have multiple fields.

For example,

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
  demo_collector = data_scope.add_collector()
  with data_scope["documents"].row() as document:
    ...
    demo_collector.collect(filename=document["filename"], summary=document["summary"])

  ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here the collector is in the top-level data scope, and it collects `filename` and `summary` fields from each row of `documents` field.

To specify what to do with the collected data, call a specific method on the collector.

### Export

The `export()` method exports the collected data to an external storage.

A *storage spec* needs to be provided for any export operation, to describe the storage and parameters related to the storage.

Export must happen at the top level of a flow, i.e. not within any child scopes created by "for each row". It takes the following arguments:

*   `name`: the name to identify the export target.
*   `target_spec`: the storage spec as the export target.
*   `primary_key_fields` (optional): the fields to be used as primary key. Types of the fields must be supported as key fields. See [Key Types](data_types#key-types) for more details.
*   `vector_index` (optional): the fields to create vector index. Each item is a tuple of a field name and a similarity metric. See [Vector Type](data_types#vector-type) for more details about supported similarity metrics.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
  demo_collector = data_scope.add_collector()
  ...
  demo_collector.export(
      "demo_storage", DemoStorageSpec(...),
      primary_key_fields=["field1"],
      vector_index=[("field2", cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The target storage is managed by CocoIndex, i.e. it'll be created by [CocoIndex CLI](/docs/core/cli) when you run `cocoindex setup`, and the data will be automatically updated (including stale data removal) when updating the index.
The `name` for the same storage should remain stable across different runs.
If it changes, CocoIndex will treat it as an old storage removed and a new one created, and perform setup changes and reindexing accordingly.
